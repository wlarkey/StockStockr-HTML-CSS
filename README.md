# StockStockr-HTML-CSS
Here are some examples of what the StockStockr UI will look like for the web application. It will utilize Bootstrap to be made responsive and mobile friendly. 

Not all links and buttons work, the application is still in development. This repo has three pages including home, browse, and info.

Buttons and figures currently only show a static image, which is currently serving as a placeholder for future implementation of real time stock figures.

The purpose of this repo is to show the general progress of the UI as development procedes.
